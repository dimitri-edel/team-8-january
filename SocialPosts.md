Notably, the tragic incident in January 2024, where a migrant boat capsized off the coast of West Africa, resulted in the deaths of over 40 Pakistanis. This event underscores the vulnerabilities faced by migrants from this area.

### Regions with Known Slave Markets
1) Libya
- Following the collapse of governance after the 2011 revolution, Libya became a hotspot for human trafficking.
- In 2017, CNN uncovered footage of actual slave auctions, where migrants were being sold for as little as $400.
- Reports suggest that such practices persist in certain regions, targeting migrants attempting to cross into Europe.
2) Conflict Zones
- Syria and Iraq: During the height of ISIS's control, the group openly operated slave markets, selling women and children—particularly from the - Yazidi minority—as sex slaves or forced labourers.
- While ISIS's power has waned, trafficking networks established during that time may still operate underground.
3) West Africa
- Some forms of traditional slavery and child labour exploitation persist in countries like Mauritania, despite the practice being officially outlawed.
- Traffickers also exploit vulnerable migrants moving through the region toward Europe.
4) South Asia
- In countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, bonded labour remains prevalent, where people are effectively "sold" to pay off debts.
- Such transactions can sometimes resemble markets, especially in rural areas.
5) Southeast Asia
- Trafficking networks in countries like Myanmar and Thailand sometimes treat vulnerable individuals as commodities, selling them into forced labour or the fishing industry.

### Types of Modern Slave Markets
1) Online Platforms:
- Traffickers increasingly use online platforms and encrypted apps to buy, sell, or advertise individuals for forced labour or sexual exploitation.
- For example, investigations have revealed trafficking-related activity on platforms like Facebook Marketplace in some regions.
2) Physical Auctions:
- In areas with weak rule of law (e.g., Libya), physical auctions for human beings are reported.
- Conflict zones and remote regions often host such transactions out of international scrutiny.
3) Forced labour Networks:
- While not "markets" in a traditional sense, forced labour networks in industries like agriculture, construction, and domestic work often involve the sale of individuals.
### Global Efforts to Combat Slave Markets
1) International Law and Enforcement:
- The UN, ILO, and other organizations work to combat slavery under frameworks like the Palermo Protocol and the Forced Labour Convention.
2) Rescue Operations:
- NGOs and agencies like International Justice Mission (IJM) conduct rescue operations and advocate for the prosecution of traffickers.
3) Awareness and Technology:
- Governments and private organizations use technology to track and shut down online trafficking activities, including marketplaces.
